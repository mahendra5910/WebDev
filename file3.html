        <p>The India national football team represents India in men's international football and is governed by the All India Football Federation.</p>

        <p>The team, which is considered as the best team in South Asia, won two gold medals at the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games while finishing fourth at the 1956 Summer Olympics. 
            India has never participated in the FIFA World Cup, although they did qualify by default for the 1950 World Cup after all other nations in their qualification group withdrew. 
            However, India withdrew prior to the beginning of the tournament. The team has also appeared four times in the AFC Asian Cup, Asia's top football championship, and finished as runners-up in 1964.
             India also participates in the SAFF Championship, the top regional football competition in South Asia. They have won the tournament record eight times since its inception in 1993.</p>

        <p>In the 21st century, besides the SAFF Championship triumphs, India won the Nehru Cup in 2007 and 2009 editions. 
            India also won the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup, by which the team qualified for the Asian Cup after a 27-year gap.</p>
